# Berlin Underground Guide

## Overview
Created an interactive map guide showcasing the underground music venues in Berlin, focusing on basements and hidden spots as part of my JavaScript final project for the ReDi School of Digital Integration. This app uses Leaflet.js for the map interface and includes custom features like dark/light mode toggle, venue information modals, and interactive pins.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Explore underground music venues on an interactive map.
- Click on venue pins to view more details (name, description, image, and website).
- Toggle between dark and light modes.
- View an "About" modal with background information about the project.
